# MAGO-LIB

A Python library to format, parse, and convert numbers from meters to maghi.

## What's this though?

### Meters (= boring üëé)

> Since 2019, the metre has been defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 
> 1/299792458 of a second, where the second is defined by a hyperfine transition frequency of caesium.

What the hell is even that? How could you ever recreate a precise meter if you found yourself in a forest alone or shipwrecked on a desert island? Important questions. But the International System of Units doesn't care about you.

### Maghi (= helpful! üëç)

How do you define a Mago? Simple enough! That's his height:

...

Of course, you'll have already figured the advantages of such unit of measurement:

- Simple and immediate definition
- The size of a Niccol√≤ is UNIVERSALLY known on Planet Earth
- This Niccol√≤ has always existed and forever will
- Its length is unchanged since the dawn of time and is extremely stable (contrary to a standard meter) to:
  - Thermal variations
  - Mechanical fatigue
  - Aging and degradation
  - Chemical stress
  - Verbal abuse
  - Intense math classes (up to 8 hours of continued exposure)
  - Electromagnetic radiation
  - Ionizing radiation (under testing)
- If you dip a meter in Nutella it'll be ruined, a Mago will smile and thank you
- Conversion between meters and maghi is very straightforward
- A handy Python library is available to help migrate the world from metric to magic
